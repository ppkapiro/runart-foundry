## Corporate Narrative — RUN Art Foundry
RUN Art Foundry is a bronze casting and full-service art workshop based in Miami for over a decade. Its portfolio includes collaborations with international artists (Carole Feuerman, Roberto Fabelo, Pedro Pablo Oliva, Williams Carmona, The Merger) and institutional commissions (Archdiocese of Miami, Ransom Everglades School). The foundry combines traditional processes (ceramic shell, monumental patinas) with scaling and mounting of large formats.
